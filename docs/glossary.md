## Glossary Version 0.0.1

### RDF
[RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) is short for Resource Description Framework. It is a data model used to describe and exchange graph data. 

### RDFS
[RDFS](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/) is short RDF Schema, or Resource Description Framework Schema. It provides a data-modelling vocabulary for RDF data.

### SPARQL
[SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) is a recursive acronym for SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language. It is used for querying data in RDF format, in a similar way that SQL is used to query relational databases. 

### Ontology
An ontology in the context of computer science is a formal representation of knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. It is used to model domain knowledge in a structured and machine-readable way, enabling better data integration, sharing, and analysis.

### OWL
[OWL](https://www.w3.org/OWL/) is short for Web Ontology Language. It is a semantic web language designed to represent rich and complex knowledge about things, groups of things, and relations between things. It is used to create ontologies in RDF.

### Knowledge Graph
A knowledge graph is a network of real-world entities—objects, events, situations, or concepts—and illustrates the relationship between them. It is used to integrate, manage, and query data from multiple sources.

### Turtle
[Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-turtle/) is a textual syntax for RDF that allows an RDF graph to be completely written in a compact and natural text form. Turtle files are usually given the extension .ttl

### URI
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to identify a resource on the internet. It can be further classified as a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or URN (Uniform Resource Name).

### IRI
An Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) is a generalization of a URI that allows a wider range of characters from the Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO 10646).

### UPRN
Unique Property References Number, a unique identifier for every building in the UK. More details can be found on the [Ordnance Survey website](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/public/unique-property-reference-numbers#what-is-a-uprn).

### ONS
The [Office for National Statistics (ONS)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) is the UK's largest independent producer of official statistics and the recognized national statistical institute of the UK.

### OS 
The [Ordnance Survey (OS)](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/) is the national mapping agency for Great Britain. It creates and maintains detailed geographic data and maps.

### LDAC
[LDAC](https://linkedbuildingdata.net/ldac/), short for Linked Data in Architecture and Construction, is a workshop aimed at providing a forum for technical discussion on the topic of handling data in architecture and construction. A large part of the workshop is concerned with the use of (semantic) web technologies.
